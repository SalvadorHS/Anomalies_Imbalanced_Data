## Anomaly Detection & Imbalanced Data Treatment 🚨
* This is a Proof-of-Concept repository for Anomaly Detection and Imbalanced Data Treatment.
* A Kaggle dataset with a business domain application is used to deal with Imbalanced Data and Anomaly-Novelty Detection.  

## Project Description 📑
The main goal is to build a series of ML Models and apply multiple algorithms for both Anomaly-Novelty Detection and Imbalance Data Treatment with graphical comparisons to show the influence of each technique on the classification performance before and after the treatments. 

Domain of knowledge:
- The challenges comprise of monitoring and analyzing the client's business metrics in real time for instant detection of the incidents that may impact their revenue.
- Build an optimal ML Model which generates alerts on client's business metrics.
- Features
  - timestamp [ float ] : is provided as a Unix epoch in seconds.
  - value [ int ] : is a real value measurement of some metric at the timestamp.
  - predicted [ float ] : is a real value prediction coming from a black box forecasting model for that timestamp. This black box forecasting model is assumed to be aware of only the true data distribution.
  - is_anomaly [ boolean ] : is a boolean value which is True if the corresponding value is identified as an anomaly.
